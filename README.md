# Lung-Cancer-Detection-by-CNN-Deep-Learning-Project
Computer Vision is one of the applications of deep neural networks and one such use case is in predicting the presence of cancerous cells, to build a classifier using Convolution Neural Network which can classify normal lung tissues from cancerous tissues.
